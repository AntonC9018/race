I think the terms need a bit of clarification.

"Map" = the game object with landscape (irrelevant for the logic background) and a track.
"Track" = roads that constitute the path or the course that the cars will need to take.
"Race" = the process where participants try to finish the course as fast as possible.
"Participant" = an entity participating in a race (bot or player).
